# Easy to use Timer
There are only one button in UI, so you are never messed up with it.<br>
Time intervals are picked up in the way that you can work efficiently in long hours, giving yourself a small rest.<br>
The idea is work for 30 minutes, rest for 5 minutes, loop the process.<br>
Also you can set your own intervals in config.txt located in program folder.
