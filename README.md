# Easy to use Timer
There are only one button in UI, so you are never messed up with it.
Time intervals are picked up in the way that you can work efficiently in long hours, giving yourself a small rest.
The idea is work for 30 minutes, rest for 5 minutes, loop the process.
Also you can set your own intervals in config.txt located in program folder.
